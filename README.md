Zigvale is a Zig implementation of the stivale2 boot protocol to be used both in kernels and bootloaders. The specification, along with C header files, may be found [here](https://github.com/stivale/stivale).

## Documentation

To generate documentation, run `zig build docs`

Zig's documentation generator is experimental and incomplete. When documentation generation has improved somewhat, I will host the documentation. In the meantime, you may both read the comments made manually, and read the documentation in the [stivale repository](https://github.com/stivale/stivale).
